    "data4 = \"GIS is a powerful tool that can be used to locate springs sourced in ophiolites. The uniquefeatures associated with these springs include a reducing subsurface environment reacting at lowtemperatures producing high pH, Ca-rich formation fluids with high dissolved hydrogen andmethane. Because of their unique chemical characteristics, these areas are often associated withmicrobes and are thought to be similar to the features that enabled life to evolve on Earth.Locating and sampling these springs could offer a deeper look into Earth's deep biosphere andthe history of life on Earth. Springs have tradiitionally been located using expensive and timeconsuming field techniques. Field work can be dangerous. The goal of this study was to developa model that could locate these unique geological features without first going into the field, thussaving time, money and reducing the risks associated with remote field localities. A GIS sitesuitability analysis works by overlaying existing geo-referenced data into a computer programand adding the different data sets after assigning a numerical value to the important fields. Forthis project, I used surface and ground water maps, geologic maps, a soil map, and a fault mapfor four counties in Northern California. The model has demonstrated that it is possible to usthis time of model and apply it to a complex geologic area to produce a usable field map forfuture field work.\"\n",
